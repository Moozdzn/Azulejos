## Context

Portuguese tiles are part of our history and has become source of inspiration for several products.
The tiles and their history are scattered around our country from historical buildings to private houses.
This project looks to create a mobile app to view and gather information about tiles such as images, annotations and its location.
The idea is to use the mobile app to crowdsource information about the tiles and as such allow the users to know a bit more about our history and our patrimony.
The user using this aplication should be able to view information about the tiles near his location and send new information about tiles he find (take photos, obtain location and add annotations). The information send will be then curated by specialists before being avaiable for other users.
  
## Scenarios
### Main Scenario
1. The user opens the "Azulejos" application.
2. The application shows a map centered on the user location, with markers for his location and tiles around him.
3. The user chooses a marker on the map or uses the search bar.
4. The application shows the information related to the chosen tile (photos, annotations).
### Secondary Scenario 1
1. The user, in the main screen, presses the "+" button to submit a new tile.
2. The application shows a new interface for a new submission where the user can add photos, annotations and confirm the tile location.
3. The user confirms the new submission and it's send to the be curated by specialists. The aplication is redirected to the main screen.

### Secondary Scenario 2
 The user acesses an interface where the user can see their submissions and their state (Submitted, Reviewed and Public).
